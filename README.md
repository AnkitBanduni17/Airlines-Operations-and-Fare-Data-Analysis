This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing flight fare data to uncover key pricing trends and patterns.
The main objective is to clean and preprocess the dataset, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and derive insights that can help understand how various factors affect flight prices.

# OBJECTIVES
Clean and preprocess raw flight fare data.

Handle missing values, whitespace, and incorrect data types.

Perform feature engineering (extracting useful time-based and route-based features).

Conduct exploratory data analysis using seaborn and matplotlib.

Visualize average flight prices per airline and other important metrics.

Address outliers and skewness in fare-related variables.

# Key tasks performed

Removed duplicate and inconsistent records.

Imputed missing values using appropriate strategies.

Transformed time columns into usable numeric formats (e.g., converting 'Duration' to total minutes).

Extracted new features from date columns for deeper analysis.

Visualized fare trends by airline, stops, and time of travel.

# Isights from visualizations

 Most flight prices lie between ₹3000 and ₹8000.
 
 Jet airways is operating at a very high scale and  most of the flights are clustered between 250 min and 1000 mins

 jet airways has the maximum no. of fleets among all the airlines

  5am to 9 pm is the rush hour for airlines operations.
